# Motion Planner for Autonomous Vehicles

This repository contains all the tools for a motion planner for self-driving cars.

The blueprint for testing and development for the motion planner is provided by the Self-Driving Car Specialization from CourseEra/University of Toronto. The controller design is implemented from [controller design repo](https://github.com/1lokeshpatel/self-driving-vehicle-controller) and is contained in `controller2d.py`.
